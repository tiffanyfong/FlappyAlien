# Version 1

Three weeks into the project: Studied how Phaser works, set up a local web server (Fenix) to test, and created the basic elements of Flappy Bird.

Currently, I have implemented the basic framework of an alien jumping when the spacebar is pressed and the pipes moving to the left.

To see the game, either download my files and use Fenix, or follow these steps if you have Python.

1. Download my files. <br>
2. Type in command line "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" <br>
3. In an Internet browser, type "127.0.0.1:8000" in the url <br>
4. Go to the directory where you downloaded my files. <br>
5. Play!<br>
