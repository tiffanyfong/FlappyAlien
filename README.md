# Flappy Alien

CS189 Second Half Project.

<strong>UPDATE: This project is officially over, but edits may come and go in the future.</strong>

This half semester, I want to recreate Flappy Bird, sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (and working with Phaser, an HTML5 game framework). There will be three biweekly versions uploaded on Github to track my progress.

To see the game, either download my files and use Fenix, or follow these steps if you have Python.

1. Download my files. <br>
2. Type in command line "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" <br>
3. In an Internet browser, type "127.0.0.1:8000" in the url <br>
4. Go to the directory where you downloaded my files. <br>
5. Play!<br>
