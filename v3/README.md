#Version 3

Final version - 7 weeks into the project.

Added custom settings including gravity, pipe frequency, "evil aliens", and "evil pipes" (play to find out mwahaha). Enabled the space bar as a reset-trigger after loss. Added game sounds from various Internet sources.

This project will have no more periodic updates after April 26.
