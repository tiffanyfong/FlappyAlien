#Version 2

Five weeks into the project: Finished implementing the general Flappy Alien game (including collision handlers, scoring, and "realistic" physics).

To see the game, either download my files and use Fenix, or follow these steps if you have Python.

1. Download my files. <br>
2. Type in command line "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" <br>
3. In an Internet browser, type "127.0.0.1:8000" in the url <br>
4. Go to the directory where you downloaded my files. <br>
5. Play!<br>
